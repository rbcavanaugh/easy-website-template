      "contents": "\nWhy should you do it this\nway?\nOnce you’re set up - its really easy to make\nchanges\nYou don’t have to mess with formatting - it just looks\nnice\nBut you can mess around with formatting and themes if\nyou like\nIts FREE and you get a cool github URL aka immediate street\ncred\nSetup is pretty simple - I’d wager using this approach has a\nsimilar learning curve to squarespace or wix and will be\nfaster.\nResources\nThe example website from this guide is here: https://rbcavanaugh.github.io\nThere are lots of great instructions for creating your own website\nusing distill. Once you get the hang of it, editing is very easy. Plus\nit’s free!\nThe main distill website is here: https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html\nThere’s a really nice tutorial here: https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-08-01-building-a-blog-with-distill/\nUsing this repository as a\ntemplate\nWe will use this repository as a template for your own website.\nIt’s set up to be a simple website that will let you include\na page about you\na page about your research\nyour CV\nOnce you’re up and running, it’s easy to increase the complexity as\nmuch as you wish.\nBonus: You barely need to know any R code to make\nthis work\nCaveat: You will have to learn a few very\nbasic git/github commands.\nStep 1: Create a github\naccount\nLink: https://github.com.\nFor your username, select something that you would like to use as\npart of your portfolio website URL.\nFor example, my github username is rbcavanaugh. The portfolio website\nexample here is set to rbcavanaugh.github.io\nStep 2. Copy the template\nOnce you’re logged into github, go to https://github.com/rbcavanaugh/rbcavanaugh.github.io and\nselect the big green button “Use this template”.\nName the repository the same way i have: username.github.io where\nusername is your username (for example, mine is rbcavanaugh.github.io\nbecause rbcavanaugh is my username).\nOnce your repository is set up (you should be taken to a page that\nhas username/username.github.io in the top left), click\nthe green code button and copy the url that you see (there’s a copy\nbutton on the right).\nGo to the repository settings and select “Pages” in the menu on the\nleft side of the page. Under branch, select “master” if it isn’t already\nselected. Then select “/docs” right next to master and select save.\nStep 3. Create an\nRstudio cloud account\nlink: https://rstudio.cloud.\nRStudio cloud is free for 25 hours/month. It’s unlikely you’ll exceed\nthis. If you do, time to download Rstudio to your own computer. But for\nnow, its much easier to use RStudio cloud and skill the\ninstallation.\nI recommend signing up with your new github account credentials\nrather than create a separate account if you’re new to github.\nIf you already have RStudio working on your local computer, you\ncan use that too. The steps will be slightly different. Notes on\ndifferences will be in italics at the bottom of each step from here\non.\nStep 3: Create a\nnew project in Rstudio Cloud\nOn Rstudio cloud, select “new project”” and then choose “New project\nfrom git”.\nPaste the URL you just copied and select “Ok”. Your project should\nstart to deploy - it may take a few minutes.\nIf using desktop RStudio, select a new project by going to File\nin the top right of your computer screen, and then selecting “new\nproject”. Select the “version control” option, paste the url, and hit\nok.\nStep 4: Connect Rstudio\ncloud to github\nOnce your project has deployed, we need to make a few changes and\nsome installation steps in RStudio.\nYou may be asked to install a few packages - generally you should do\nthis.\nIn the bottom right “Files” pane, rename the blue .Rproj file. It\nstill says “rbcavanaugh.github.io.Rproj”. You want it to say\n“username.github.io.Rproj”.\nOpen the setup.R file in the /R folder by clicking on it in the\n“Files” pane. Work through the few lines of code by carefully reading\nthe code comments (preceeded by a ‘#’). This is the only time you will\nneed to run R code.\nPause\nHave you had any trouble installing packages or connecting Rstudio to\ngithub? If you have, now is the time to troubleshoot them. These are\nnecessary at this point. If you’re using Rstudio desktop and having\nissues, I suggest trying to get setup in Rstudio cloud.\nStep 5: Get oriented with\nRstudio\nIn Rstudio - here’s what you should be looking at:\n\nTop left pane is where your scripts (.rmd files)\ngo. You have a script for most pages on your website. The template\nwebsite has 2 scripts, one for the home page (it must be called\nindex.rmd) and one for a research page (research.rmd). There’s also a\n.pdf file with an example CV. This will make up the third page of the\nwebsite.\nTop right pane has 6 different\ntabs. Two of them are important: “Build” and “Git”. The “Build” tab has\na button called “Build website”. This renders all of your website\ncode/documents together and copeies the results into the “docs” folder.\nYou have to do this to see your changes and upload them. The “Git” tab\nholds update about transferring your website to github so it can go on\nthe internet. More on this later.\nBottom left pane has two important tabs,\n“Console” and “Terminal”. You will see R code run here sometimes. We\nwill also run some git code in the terminal tab. It’s really easy, I\npromise.\nBottom right pane is a file viewer, and helps\nyou open, move, rename etc. files. If you ever need to navigate back to\nthis home folder for your website, hit the blue cube with an “R” inside\nof it.\nStep 6: Website layout file\n“yml”\nIn Rstudio, open the file called “_site.yml”. This file holds key\ninformation about how your website is structured. Mine looks like this.\nFor a script to be linked on your website, it should be listed here.\nname: \"rbcavanaugh.github.io\"\ntitle: \"Rob Cavanaugh | PhD Student\"\noutput_dir: \"docs\"\nnavbar:\n  right:\n    - text: \"Home\"\n      href: index.html\n    - text: \"Research\"\n      href: research.html\n    - text: \"CV\"\n      href: cv-cavanaugh.pdf\noutput: distill::distill_article\nImportant: The .yml file is both case sensitive and sensitive to\nwhitespace. It’s a bit annoying, but be careful about how each item is\nindented, because it does matter and you will get an error if the indent\nisn’t right.\nChanges to make:\nChange the name of your website to your username.github.io\nChange the title of your website. This goes in the top left of the\nweb page.\nChange the name of the .pdf file to represent what your pdf CV is\ncalled.\n\nIf you don’t a CV handy right now, you can “comment out” these two\nlines of code by putting a hashtag (also called pound sign) in front of\nthe two CV lines so that they are not included. Like this:\n\n\nname: \"rbcavanaugh.github.io\"\ntitle: \"Rob Cavanaugh | PhD Student\"\noutput_dir: \"docs\"\nnavbar:\n  right:\n    - text: \"Home\"\n      href: index.html\n    - text: \"Research\"\n      href: research.html\n#    - text: \"CV\"\n#      href: cv-cavanaugh.pdf\noutput: distill::distill_article\nStep 7: Create your home page\nOpen the index.Rmd file.\nThe template file is pretty short. The whole script is just this\nright now:\n---\ntitle: \"Rob Cavanaugh - website demo\"    \nsite: distill::distill_website\nimage: \"images/profile.jpg\"\nlinks:\n  - label: Google Scholar\n    url: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7pMLCJsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra\n  - label: Twitter\n    url: https://twitter.com/rb_cavanaugh\n  - label: Email\n    url: mailto:rob.cavanaugh@pitt.edu\noutput:\n  postcards::jolla\n---\n\nI'm a PhD candidate at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.lrcl.pitt.edu/) and ASHA-certified speech-language pathologist. My research aims to improve the effectiveness and clinical implementation of aphasia rehabilitation services from two perspectives: (1) specifying the active ingredients of aphasia treatments and (2) developing technology-based tools to accelerate the clinical implementation of aphasia research.\nTo-do list:\nChange the title to reflect your name.\nUpload your profile image to the images/ folder and make sure that\nyou have changed the filename in the image: line to match\nyour profile image filename.\nChange the google scholar, twitter, and email links to be\nyours.\nyou can add any other links here that you want. Other examples might\nbe orcid, your ncbi page, your Pitt lab page, etc.\nChoose a template for your profile page. The different templates are\nshown here: https://github.com/seankross/postcards. You might want\nto add the text you want (next step) before worrying too much about the\ntemplate. But you could change the current template from\npostcards::jolla to postcards::trestles for\nexample. Remember to make sure not to change the amount of indent on\nthat line.\nUpdate the paragraph below with your own content. The formatting\nuses markdown writing style which you can preview here in section 3. https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf.\nStep 8: Add your research\nOpen the research.Rmd folder. You’ll that I’m using headers for\n“Publications” and for “Presentations”. Feel free to change this however\nyou would like. I’ve just copied and pasted a few items from my CV here\nas an example.\nBonus: self-archiving: If you want to link to a\nself-archived paper, you could do it like such - surrounding the\ncitation in square brackets, and putting the file, which you’ve saved in\nyour folder, in parentheses after. If you’re not sure about\nself-archiving, see: https://www.csdisseminate.com.\n\nresults in:\nAuthors, Amazing (2022). A very provacative\ntitle. Journal of Awesome.\nStep 9: Send your website to\ngithub\nIn the top right pane of Rstudio, click on “Build Website”. Lets\nhope you don’t get any errors! If you do, its probably a .yml error. If\nsuccessful, you should see a pop-up of your website (this is a local\npreview). In Rstudio cloud, you may need to allow pop-ups…\nIf it looks good, move on to step 3. If not, fix it. Or don’t and\nmove on anyway.\nOk - now we need to send the website files to github.\nIn the bottom right of Rstudio, select Terminal (its right next to\nconsole). You’re going to type in 3 lines of git code (horray for\nlearning git!).\ncredit: https://twitter.com/allison_horst/status/1523744022421860352?s=20&t=Eku6rph06M7r3kl3j-GPNAThis image shows you what you’re going to be doing. Right now, your\nchanges are in your working directory (the factory where you make\nstuff). We need to send them to the local repository (the place that\nholds information about your files and the changes you made to them on\nyour computer). After that, we need to send them from the local\nrepository to github, (the remote repository) so that they can be\npublished online.\nIn the terminal, type these three lines verbatim.\ngit add .\n“Add the changes” - This is like packing up your chagnes and getting\nthem ready to ship to the local repo. The period in the line of code\nmeans add all the changes.\ngit commit -m \"This is the first time I'm sending changes\"\n“Commit” the changes. This is your UPS driver taking the changes to\nthe local repository. the -m adds a message to go along\nwith your changes. You need to include a message, and its good practice\nto include something useful.\ngit push\n“Push” the changes. This send sthe changes from your local repository\nto github.\nStep 10: Publish your\nwebsite!\nLast, go back to your github repository.\nGo to the repository settings and select “Pages” in the menu on the\nleft side of the page. you should see something that says:\n“Your site is live at https://rbcavanaugh.github.io/”\nIf not, make sure that the “branch” is set to “master” and that the\noption next to this says “/docs”.\nWait a few minutes and refresh the page again. Click on the link to\ngo see your new website!.\nTroubleshooting\nHey now that you have a github account, you can raise issues! If\nyou’re stuck, go to my template page (https://github.com/rbcavanaugh/rbcavanaugh.github.io),\nselect issues, create a new issue, and let me know where you’re stuck.\nInclude error messages, maybe a screen shot or two. I’ll help you\nout.\nFAQ\nQ: What if I just want a single page website?\nA: Fantastic! Delete everything in your project except the following,\nbuild the website, and send to github like normal.\nindex.Rmd\nYour .Rproj file\nthe images folder\nYour CV (you can link to your CV the same way you link to papers\nin step 8 above)\nQ: Are there more themes or layouts?\nA: yes! There are lots of themes. We’ve used the {distill} R package\nto create this website because its very easy. There are other options\nout there. (Quarto, Jekyll being two of them).\nNext Steps:\nClick through the distill website for other features you want to\ninclude: https://rstudio.github.io/distill/\nYou could change the coloring, the themes, font.\nAdd another page. Maybe you want a page for pictures of your\ncat.\nAdd a blog. Think livejournal but 25 years later. .\nGo do some actual work :)\n",
